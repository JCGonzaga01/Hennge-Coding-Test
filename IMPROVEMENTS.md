# List of possible improvements

 1. **Search Functionality**
      - Currently only date search are available, improving the search functionality by making it able to search other fields can be a great feature in a mailing application.
      - In order to improve the search functionality, we can update the current date search and make it more of a general search functionality. We can even add some regEx rules to make the search functionality more useful by adding some keywords and rules search for better searching.
  2. **Unread Mails**
	  - Currently, the application doesn't have yet any indicator when the email has already been read. Having this feature can help user identifies which email hasn't been read and which are already been read.
	  - In order to improve this, we can either add some ribbon tag indicator to each mail or emphasize unread mails by making changing the font-weight or subject's background-color.
3.  **Tagging Option**
    - Sometimes user wants to group mail based on their preferences, like mails relating to work or mails relating to personal matters. This can easily help them to check all mails related to some tags without searching or browsing the whole mail content.
    - In order to do that, adding some Tag component can achieve this, a UI that is visible to users is also helpful, and also integrating it with search or sort functionality can ease the the searching and filtering of mails.
